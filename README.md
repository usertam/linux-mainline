# linux-mainline
This is my personal linux-mainline pkgbuild used on Arch Linux, which has been customized to be stripped of any building procedures, and only performs the packaging of the built kernel source. This leaves the job of fetching the source and the building up to the user, which is what I prefer.  
Therefore, errors will naturally occur when something is not built properly, so avoid blaming the pkgbuild.
